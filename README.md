# bioinformatics_scripts
The old scripts I used for mostly series of bioinformatics tools execution

## script languages
Most scripts are written in bash, R, only some of them were written in python and perl or once DOS shell script.

## origin of these scripts
These scripts are very old (I don't even know if they still work or not LOL.) and were written back in the time when I only needed to run some **bioinformatics analysis for a sample or a batch**. I have classified the scripts based on their usage at my best. **I put them on just for records**.

To be honest, most of the scripts were **not well-written** as by then I did not need to really need to e.g. create parameter inputs for scripts, not written in modules/classes...etc to achieve the requirements, as most of these are for **research purposes or just one-time analysis purposes at my convenience**, and we did not even need to automate them.
